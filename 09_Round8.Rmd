## Biggest Upset {-}

Only in terms of the scoreline as Bournemouth recorded their first six goal haul versus Hull, becoming the 24th of the 47 all-time PL teams to do so.
Somewhat surprisingly, 26 sides have performed the feat since it was last accomplished by Manchester United more than 5 seasons ago

Bournemouth v Hull was the 819th different matchup in the PL. Games in just one season is the most likely combination
