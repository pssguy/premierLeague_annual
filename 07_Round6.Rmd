* Two teams unlikely to feature regularly in this section but another exciting finale in a Palace game. They have now secured three points from games in which they have scored in injury time 

* Palace score 9 goals in three consecutive games for first time in their Premier league history and are in their highest position (7th) after six games

* Since Defoe joined Sunderland, he accounts for 35% of the team's goals. Only Kane(37%) at Tottenham has a higher proportion for clubs that have been in the top tier ever since then

## Biggest Upset {-}

Arsenal 3 - 0 Chelsea

With Chelsea unbeaten in the previous nine league head to head encounters this was something of a surprise, equalling their biggest ever triumph over their rivals in the Premier League

However, as can be seen, Arsenal had an even longer period of dominance; at one stage going 19 games without a loss - although all but two were ties or single goal victories



## Chart of Week {-}

Picking on West Ham  again, I know, but the turnaround from arguably their best-ever PL season is worth noting. Their fifth defeat has come after only six games, contrasting with the record 22 games it took to lose so many last campaign
