* Desperate defending by Hull proved to no avail as United scored in injury time but they will not be first to crack 100 goals for in 'Fergie Time'

* Rashford is youngest PL goalscorer by a player managed by Mourinho

* Rooney now has had a goal and/or assist in six successive league games, a sequence unmatched by him since December 2013

## Biggest Upset {-}

None really. The three top positions are already occupied by the pre-season favourites and the promoted clubs good showing in the first two rounds was not repeated 



## Chart of Week {-}

It is hard to believe that Alan Pardew would have survived Palace's worst ever spell of just 2 wins in 24 league games unless  you take into account  

* He is a former player
* The dismal run straddled two seasons and a transfer window
* Last year's FA Cup run
* Palace fans don't expect them to stay in top flight five years
