# Introduction {-}


This is an 'on the fly' annual based on the 2016/17 Premier League season, updated weekly with charts, tables, highlight videos and trivia related to the games played.

Each chapter features static visualizations relevant to the games that week. Extended, fully-interactive and constantly updated versions can be found on the accompanying [dashboard site](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/plannualupdate/)
    
Additional data is available at the
[Premier League Web site](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/premierLeague/)

Most of the underlying data is unofficial, unguaranteed error-free and available for a million dollars.
There is also likely to be use of James Curley's excellent [engsocccerdata](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata) and, of course, many packages produced by the R community, especially [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown)
