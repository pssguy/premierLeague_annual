Another quality game where a draw was the only fair result    

The 20 points with which Man City lead the league is the fewest for the top spot after 9 Premier League games since 2001/2. However, the 19 points for fifth-placed Spurs is the highest at the same stage - equalled only by the same club four years ago

First goal was conceded after 11 passes - not one of which started in Chelsea's half
